This code relates to my article titled *MIMO Capacity Maximization With a Practical Model for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces* published in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.

The code is written in Python with the `numpy` framework for linear algebra computation, along with other frameworks like `matplotlib` for plotting, `time` for measuring computation time, etc.

The method `main()` in `MIMO_RIS_Prac.py` is the entry point to be executed. The explanations about its parameters and returns have been detailed inside the code.
